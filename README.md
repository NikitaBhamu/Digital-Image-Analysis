# Digital-Image-Analysis
This repository contains 3 assignments of DIA :- <br /><br />
## Assignment 1 : Simultaneous Contrast Experiment
Created an image with foreground square and background. And then changing the intensity of the background to observe the change in the contrast.<br /><br />

**Assignment 2 : Color Quantization and Color Transfer**<br />
There are two parts to the assignment :-<br />
The first part of the assignment is an implementation of parts from the paper on color quantization : < p297-heckbert.pdf ><br />
These are:<br />
• Polpularity algorithm<br />
• Median cut algorithm<br />
• Floyed and Steinberg algorithm<br />
The second part of the assignment is the implementation of transfering of color to grey level images using the algorithm described in the paper both using global method and using swatches :  < colorize.pdf ><br /><br />

**Assignment 3 : Digital Make Up Transfer and Stylization**<br />
The idea of this assignment is that given a reference face image A with a make up, and another face image B without a makeup (a different face), obtain the face image B' with makeup derived from the reference image A.<br />
Bilateral filtering in used in this and for warping the image the triangle method is used.<br />
